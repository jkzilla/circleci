# Deliveroo CircleCI helper image

The purpose of this image is to make interacting with CircleCI 2.0 easier, and provide a few opinionated suggestions on how to best run CI pipelines.

In order to use this image, please use it as the starter image in your CircleCI config file (`.circleci/config.yml`):

```yaml
docker:
  - image: deliveroo/circleci:$VERSION
```

...where `VERSION` equals the version you want to use. Hint: its value is located in the `VERSION` file in this repo.

The image comes with a few standard tools, like `bash`, `docker`, `docker-compose`, `heroku` CLI, `aws` CLI, and `python` with `pip`. It also has some custom helpers - please see below for details.

## Custom helper: `ci`

`ci` is just an alias for a more complicated `docker-compose -f
docker-compose.ci.yml -p "${CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME}"`. It is opinionated in
that it assumes that the Docker composition for your CI pipeline (if you're
using one, of course), is stored in a file called `docker-compose.ci.yml` and
that your application service is called `app`. This way you can reserve your
vanilla Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) just for development
purposes.

If you built the Docker Image with `ci build`, `ci tag` can be used to tag the
image in a suitable format for the `push_image_to_ecr` script.

```yaml
# In .circleci/config.yml, add this as one of the steps to build and tag the Docker image
- run:
    name: Build and Tag the CI Image
    command: |
      ci build
      ci tag
```

## Custom helper: `wfi`

The other helper you can find useful is `wfi`. It's just a `wait-for-it.sh` script with a shorter, more catchy name. Unlike `ci`, which is supposed to be run directly, `wfi` only makes sense to be run from a composition. As an example, let's see a simple Rails test composition:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:9.6.3

  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.ci
    links:
      - db

  wait:
    image: deliveroo/circleci:$VERSION
    links:
      - db
```

Now in your test steps you can use `wfi` to wait for the DB to come up before you set it up from a Rails schema:

```yaml
- run:
    name: Wait for the DB to start
    command: ci run --rm wait wfi db:5432

- run:
    name: Set up the DB
    command: ci run --rm app bin/rails db:create db:migrate
```

## Custom helper: `ensure_head`

`ensure_head` will check whether the CI run was triggered by the current `HEAD` of the branch it ran from. Running from outdated commits may be wasteful at best, and dangerous at worst. In case of continuous deployment you can imagine re-running an old CI run sneakily changing the code in production to an older version.

In order to use `ensure_head`, just add it as a step to your CircleCI config file:

```yaml
- run:
    name: Ensure HEAD
    command: ensure_head
```

## Custom helper: `push_lambda`

`push_lambda` is a helper to push an externally generated zip file to S3 and use it to update the source code of a Lambda function. It assumes that `AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `AWS_S3_OBJECT_KEY` and `AWS_REGION` environment variables are set - either directly or indirectly (see `print_env`),

In order to use `push_lambda`, just add it as a step to your CircleCI config file:

```yaml
- run:
    name: Update Lambda function
    command: push_lambda $function_name
```

## Custom helper: `push_image_to_ecr`

`push_image_to_ecr` wraps around the logic required to use your AWS environment
variables to log in to an ECR repository and tag and push your local image
there. In order to use it, you will need to set two environment variables in
the CircleCI project dashboard: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` -
these are used by the AWS CLI that lets us retrieve Docker credentials.

Images are tagged with the commit hash by default. It is also possible to add
custom tags as parameters. In most cases this is not necessary.

In order to use `push_image_to_ecr` in your CircleCI pipeline, add a step like
this.

```yaml
- run:
    name: Push image to ECR
    command: |
      push_image_to_ecr
```

The script is convention-driven and will take parameters from common environment
variables.
* It will take image name from `$IMAGE_NAME` if defined, or `$CIRCLE_PROJECT_REPONAME`
  if not. One or other must be set.
* It will take region from `$AWS_ECR_REPO_REGION` if set, or `$AWS_REGION` if not. One
  or other must be set.
* It will take the ECR repo from `$AWS_ECR_REPO_URL`

Here's an example of adding custom tags:

```yaml
- run:
    name: Push image to ECR
    command: |
      push_image_to_ecr custom1 custom2
```

Here's an example of overriding the region

```yaml
- run:
    name: Push image to ECR
    command: |
      AWS_REGION=$STAGING_REGION push_image_to_ecr
```

## Custom helper: `pull_image_from_ecr`

`pull_image_from_ecr` wraps around the logic required to pull a Docker image from AWS ECR.
This command takes the same inputs as the `push_image_to_ecr` helper, except that it operates in the reverse direction.

```yaml
- run:
    name: Pull image from ECR
    command: |
      pull_image_from_ecr \
        --image-name IMAGE_NAME \
        --ecr-repo ECR_REPO \
        --aws-region AWS_REGION
```

## Custom helper: `push_image_to_docker_hub`

`push_image_to_docker_hub` logs in to Docker Hub and pushes your image there.

You will need to supply your Docker Hub credentials in the `$DOCKER_USER` and `$DOCKER_PASS`
environment variables.

The script takes at least one full docker image name as a parameter. If you supply multiple
image names, it will attempt to push each one in a loop.

In order to use `push_image_to_docker_hub` in your CircleCI pipeline, add a step like this:-

```yaml
- run:
    name: Push image to docker hub
    command: |
      push_image_to_docker_hub \
        deliveroo/myimage:$(VERSION)
```

## Custom helper: `clean_up_reusable_docker`

`clean_up_reusable_docker` wraps around the logic required to remove dangling containers, and old images from the remote Docker host used by CircleCI. It's a way to still be able to use cache, while not wasting all that space:

```yaml
- run:
    name: Clean up reusable Docker
    command: clean_up_reusable_docker
```

## Custom helper: `print_env`

`print_env` is a bash script which takes prefix and replaces prefixed environment variables with their non-prefixed versions. You're always meant to exec it in-place for the changes to be made to the current shell:

```yaml
- run:
    name: Push to staging
    command: |
      `print_env staging`
      push_to_heroku $staging_app_name
```

## Custom helper: `scan_container_vulnerabilities`

`scan_container_vulnerabilities` is a bash script that wraps snyk container testing & monitoring which then parses the results into GitHub readable markdown and sends vulnerability notifications back to the original PR where appropriate. 

```yaml
- run:
    name: Scan container vulnerabilities
    command: scan_container_vulnerabilities
```

Additional args:

- `NO_COMMENT` overrides the default behaviour of commenting back to the PR
- `CONTAINER_TAG` sets a custom tag for container images 
- `SNYK_SEVERITY_THRESHOLD` sets the threshold for the severity of the vulnerabilities to report back to the user. Possible values are: `low`, `medium`, `high` or `critical`. Defaults to `critical`. Snyk's rating [reference](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020021058-Critical-severity-migration).

## Future work

Over time we may end up adding utilities here to help us work with various other parts of our infrastructure.
